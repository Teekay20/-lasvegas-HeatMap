The summer of 2024 was the hottest on record in Las Vegas, setting new benchmarks for average high, average low, and overall average temperatures. This extreme heat significantly exacerbated the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, with urban areas experiencing intensified temperatures. Land Surface Temperature (LST) soared, contributing to heat stress and increasing health risks, especially for vulnerable populations. The city's low Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) reflected stressed vegetation, which struggled to provide natural cooling, while the low Urban Fractional Vegetation Index (UFVI) highlighted the lack of green spaces, further compounding the heat problem. These conditions strained public health, raised energy demands for cooling, and disrupted local ecosystems. The extreme heat and its effects on vegetation also led to a higher risk of heat-related illnesses and environmental degradation. Visualizing these factors on maps is essential for identifying vulnerable areas, guiding urban planning, and developing strategies to mitigate the impact of future heat events.
